(T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
 Visualizing high dimensional data. (Datacamp)
 
 T-SNE reduces samples from higher dimensional space into 2 or 3 dimensional space for easy visualization of the dataset. It is different from PCA as it  It is a great technique for dimensionality reduction as it holds the nearness of samples really well. However, it is computationally very expensive and should not be used on a very big dataset.
